# Mobile robot
 Project of an autonomous mobile robot as a master's thesis project.

 As for now, there is Arduino Nano for DC motors steering via L298N modules. As a reference speed there are optical encoders used. For optimal and synchronized speed for every wheel there is PID used, based on Arduino PID v1 library.
